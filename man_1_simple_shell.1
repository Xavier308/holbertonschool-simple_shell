.SH NAME
C-SIMPLE SHELL \- a minimalistic shell for command execution.

.SH DESCRIPTION
C-SIMPLE SHELL is a simple UNIX command interpreter that reads commands from the standard input or from a file and executes them.

This shell supports executing both built-in commands and external programs. It handles errors gracefully and can be extended with additional features easily.

.SH OPTIONS
This shell does not support any command-line options at the current version.

.SH USAGE
Start the shell by typing:
.RS
c-simple-shell
.RE

Once started, the shell prompt appears as:
.RS
#supershell$
.RE

You can then type commands directly into the shell.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The shell supports the following built-in commands:

.TP
.B cd [directory]
Changes the current directory to
.I directory
. If no directory is provided, it changes to the home directory.

.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell.

.SH EXTERNAL COMMANDS
The shell can execute any external commands available in the system PATH.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell uses the
.B PATH
environment variable to resolve commands. If
.B PATH
is not set, it defaults to executing
.I "/bin/ls"
.

.SH RETURN VALUES
This shell returns
.I 0
upon successful command execution and
.I 1
if an error occurs.

.SH FILES
.I /bin/*
.br
Standard location for executable files which the shell can execute.
